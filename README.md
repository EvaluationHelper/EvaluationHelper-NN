# EvaluationHelper-NN

## Introduction
---

This Project is was  an assignment for an introductory python course of the institute for technology Karlsruhe, Germany (KIT). It's a lightweight neural network model with one hidden layer and can be trained to analyze the KIT survey sheets for university courses. It is a simple implementation build from scratch using only numpy for computation and pillow for image processing.

## Brief Overview of the Model and Programm Structure
---

The evaluation sheets are multiple choice with 14 questions. To answer the questions the students check on of five boxes.

The network is trained to classify, whether a box ist checked or not. The input layer with 1600 nodes that corresponds to a cut out picture of a box with 40x40 pixel. It is implemented with one hidden layer using sigmoid as activation function and cross entropy as a loss function. The default parameters for training are batches of 50 and 30 epochs of training.

When you start the evaluation, a corner detection routine is launched. With the detected corners, sheets that have been scanned with light displacement can be adjusted and the positions of all question boxes can be determined. Next, all boxes will be cut out as a 40x40 pixel image and a pre trained model will predict whether or not the box has been checked. For each of the boxes this information is saved and the programm will display interesting statistics to the user.

## How use EvaluationHelper-NN
---

### Start the evaluation


Download the project to your local machine. Make sure to have numpy and PIL installed. There are no additional dependencies required.
The main entry point to the programm is launch.py located in the projects `src` directory. It can be started using the command line terminal. In the project's root directory navigate to the src directory:
```
cd src
``` 
After starting the programm with 
```
python launch.py
```
you will be promted to enter the path to a directory with the scanned surveys. 

The terminal output will provide information about the progress of the EvaluationHelper and print interesing statistics for each of the analyzed survey sheets.

### How to Read the Survey Statistics

The create_print_statistics() routine will provide block of information about each of the survey sheets individually.
```
Sheet number:  23
++(2): 5 , +(1): 3 , 0(0): 2 , -(-1): 1 , --(-2): 1
Answered questions: 12 / 14
Question was not answered:  [11, 12]
Average:  0.833
Variance: 1.639
```
The first line will tell you the number of the analyzed sheet.

Each question of the survey can be answered with five measures of agreement:
```
++ - fully agree
+  - agree somewhat
0  - indifferent
-  - disagree somewhat
-- - completaly disagree
```

The secont line of each statistics block tells you how often each of these five options have been checked. For instace, in the example above this would mean in sheet 1 "fully agree" has been checked five times. 

The statistics of a survey sheet will also tell you how many of the  questions have been answered at all, which questions have been answered multiple times as well as a average and variance of the five options to answer. With ++ equating to 2 down to -- equating to -2.



### How to Use Previously Detected Corners

To adjust slight displacement of the scanned sheets the `create_reference()` function called in launch.py will start a corner detection routine per default. The information about the detected corners is saved to `/data/corners.json`. If you want to use the detected corners from a previous run, change the first argument in the function call in line 35 of launch.py to `False` as seen below:

```python
create_reference(False, usr_boegen_path, paths[1], paths[0], paths[3], paths[2], reference_sheet_name)
```

### How to Retrain the Neural Network

Per default the programm will use a pre-trained model. The information about its weights and biases are stored in `/data/model.json`. You can retrain the model using the existing dataset by naivating to the nn directory

```
cd src/nn
```
and starting the routine to train the model with

```
python train.py
```

It is possible to change the running parameters of the training like `batch size` or `number of epochs` by passing arguments.

```
python train.py -e 40 -b 60
```
This will train the model with 40 epochs and batches of 60. To see all the possible arguments, look at the argparser in train.py's main function.
